				<h3 id="Projet1">Coroico, Bolivia</h3>

					<p><strong>05th to 15th of March:</strong> Bolivia Project in collaboration with Coeur de Forêt<br>
					<strong>Location:</strong> Coroico<br>
					<strong>Particularity: </strong>Huge diversity<br>
					<strong>Goal: </strong>Reforestation to offset culture of Coca<br>

					<p> Bolivia has a highly diverse climate, with a succession of ecological strata ranging from the arid plains of the Altiplano, through tropical valleys, to snow-capped peaks at 6,000 metres above sea level. The Yungas region, where the project is located, is considered a hot spot because it is an area with more than 1,500 species but has lost 70% of its original habitat. It is home to orchids that are unique in the world. Tropical fruits, coffee, coca, cocoa and tobacco find optimal conditions to flourish here, thanks to the hot and humid climate and abundant rainfall. Mining is also common and poorly regulated, often leading to widening of river beds and pollution of waterways. In addition, there is a lack of a waste management system, which in turn contributes to the pollution of the local environment. </p>
					<p>The Yungas region has also been plagued by the trafficking of precious wood such as Mara (Swietenia macrophylla) , which is on the IUCN Red List of Species and has almost disappeared from the region. Deforestation is also following a dramatic increase in the region, while 12,000 ha of forest disappeared between 2000 and 2005, 35,500 ha were wiped off the map between 2005 and 2010.  </p>
					<p>However, the traditional and main crop of the region is Coca (Erythroxylum coca), a demanding plant that causes many environmental problems. Cultivated in monoculture, coca greatly impoverishes the soil, causing its erosion that can go as far as landslides. Although its area of cultivation is legally limited, soil degradation pushes coca growers to extend the coca cultivation plots. The Las Yungas region is, however, known as the traditional coca production area, where the leaves produced are mainly used for the legal consumption (chewing) of the leaves by the local population. </p>
					<p>Bolivia still has a stable average HDI (Human Development Index) of 0.675 in 2012, but there are wide disparities between rural and urban areas. The strong development of the economic capital, La Paz, is in sharp contrast to the lack of development in the rural areas. 
					<br>In this context, the Cœur de Forêt association aims, without totally replacing it, to provide concrete alternatives to coca cultivation and must take into consideration the financial interests of local producers. </p>

				<h3 id="projet2">Tena, Ecuador</h3>
				
					<p><strong>1st to 30th of April: </strong>Ecuador Project in collaboration with Ishpingo<br>
					<strong>Location: </strong>Tena<br>
					<strong>Particularity: </strong>Forest’s density<br>
					<strong>Goal: </strong>Preservation of local populations</p>
					
					<p>Since 2005, the Ishpingo association has been implementing a model of sustainable development based on participatory agroforestry in which farmers reforest their land with timber and fruit species.</p>
					<p>The impact of these reforestation actions is threefold:
					<br>-They enable local populations to practice self-consumption through the production of fruit, timber and ingredients used for traditional medicine.
					<br>-Their income, and therefore their standard of living, increases significantly, thanks in part to the sale of part of the fruit tree harvest to our fair trade cooperative.
					<br>-By planting trees we also contribute to sequestering CO2 (carbon dioxide) and thus to limiting global warming for the whole world.</p>
					<p>Unlike many organizations, the Ishpingo association is convinced that long-term positive results in reforestation projects are only possible when local people are trained and actively participate in the project. Only their awareness and commitment will ensure the sustainability and replicability of the actions we undertake.</p>

				<h3 id="projet3">Medellin &#38 Bogota, Colombia</h3>
				
				<p><strong>10th to 30th of May: </strong>Colombia Project in collaboration with ColomBIOdiversidad<br>
				<strong>Location: </strong>Medellin and Bogota<br>
				<strong>Particularity: </strong>Dedicated to marine forests and ecosystems<br>
				<strong>Goal:</strong> Raise awareness and promote diversity to Colombian citizens<br>
				
				<p>ColomBIOdiversidad is a series of free events promoting Colombian biodiversity, organized annually since 2014 by the French-Colombian NGO Envol Vert in Medellin and Bogota. The aim of the festival is to raise awareness and involve as many citizens and legal entities as possible in the issues of biodiversity and environmental protection.</p>
				<p>The festival is organized every year around the International Day of Biodiversity (22 May) and with the support of public partners (National Parks), international cooperation (AFD) and various international and national NGOs. </p>
				<p>In 2020, Envol Vert and its partners have chosen to deal with the theme of the Sea in order to make Colombians discover the marine life which remains quite unknown. Besides, the Sea in Colombia represents half of the National Territory! For these reasons, it seemed necessary to raise citizens' awareness on the impact of human activities on the marine ecosystem.</p>
